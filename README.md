## 📝 Customizing Your Routines

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "nombre": "Basic HIIT Routine",
  "descripcion": "A simple HIIT routine to get started.",
  "pasos": [
    {
      "numero": 1,
      "titulo": "Warm-up",
      "descripcion": "Light stretches to get ready.",
      "tiempo": 60
    },
    {
      "numero": 2,
      "titulo": "Sprint",
      "descripcion": "Run at full speed.",
      "tiempo": 30
    }
  ]
}
```
You can easily add or modify steps and routines by editing the JSON file.
